            I discuss my thoughts on video games that incorporate a subscription based <a href="https://medium.com/@mitchellc01/the-end-of-game-ownership-my-thoughts-on-subscription-models-for-video-games-8d3fefb6508">"pay-to-play"</a> model and how most people no longer own a physical copy of their games.

Also talk about techniques for the average user to protect their information online, like proper password management.

            I show two different methods for an Oculus Quest user to <a href="https://youtu.be/ROlUHFe38lk">connect their headset to their PC</a>, including Oculus Link and Oculus Air Link. I also present the pros and cons to each of these methods.</p>

          A presentation on the work I did for the NIST (National Institute of Research and Technology) summer undergrad research fellowship. I experiment with different ways for people to <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19n75puTRmQ4gznFW3Asw5CsvRRfOWzrGxlHQyzRvwgc/edit?usp=sharing">view models of real-world objects in virtual reality</a> that were scanned using photogrammetry, and implement features users may use to interact with these models.
